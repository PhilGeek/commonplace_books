# Nemesius Bishop of Emisa

## *De natura hominis*

> Hipparchus says that rays extend from the eyes and with their extremities lay hold on external bodies like the touch of hands, (2) and thus transmit their reception to the sense of sight. 

(*De natura hominis* 7; R.W. Sharples and P.J. van der Eijk, *Nemesius On the Nature of Man*, Liverpool University Press, 2008, 104)

Sharples and Eijk note that Hipparchus of Nicæa was a 2nd-century BCE astronomer and geographer and that the present passage is virtually identical to Aëtius/Pseudo-Plutarch *Placita* (*Tenets*) 4.13

# Pseudo-Plutarch

## *Placita*

> Hipparchus, that the visual rays extend from both the eyes to the superficies of bodies, and give to the sight the apprehension of those same bodies, after the same manner in which the hand touching the extremity of bodies gives the sense of feeling.

(*Placita* 4 13; Crowell, *The Complete Works of Plutarch*, volume 3, 1909)

# Augustine

## *De Trinitate*

> For the mind does not know other minds and not know itself, as the eye of the body sees other eyes and does not see itself; for we see bodies through the eyes of the body, because, unless we are looking into a mirror, we cannot refract and reflect the rays themselves which shine for through the eyes, and touch whatever we discern---a subject, indeed, which is treated of most subtly and obscurely, until it be clearly demonstrated whether the fact be so, or whether it be not. But whatever is the nature of the power by which we discern through the eyes, certainly, whether it be rays or anything else, we cannot discern with the eyes that power itself; but we inquire into it with the mind, and if possible, understand this with the mind.

(*De Trinitate* 9 3; Rev Arthur West Haddan, B.D., *On the Trinity, Augustine of Hippo*, Fig, 2012, 238)

Notice that Augustine, after having introduced the extramissionist imagery of rays, immediately brackets that commitment, claiming that it is treated subtly and obscurely and claims that the explanation of perceptual discernment by rays has not yet been clearly demonstrated.
