# Nemesius Bishop of Emisa

## *De natura hominis*

> Hipparchus says that rays extend from the eyes and with their extremities lay hold on external bodies like the touch of hands, (2) and thus transmit their reception to the sense of sight. 

(*De natura hominis* 7; R.W. Sharples and P.J. van der Eijk, *Nemesius On the Nature of Man*, Liverpool University Press, 2008, 104)

Sharples and Eijk note that Hipparchus of Nicæa was a 2nd-century BCE astronomer and geographer and that the present passage is virtually identical to Aëtius/Pseudo-Plutarch *Placita* (*Tenets*) 4.13

> Geometricians draw cones which are formed from the intersection of the rays sent out through the eyes. For they say that the eyes send out rays, the right eye to the left, the left eye to the right, and as a result a cone is formed by their intersection, which is why sight that can encompass many visible things all at once, but sees exactly only those parts where the rays intersect. This is at any rate how, when looking at the floor, we often do not see the coin lying there, though looking hard, until the intersection of the rays falls upon that part where the coin lies and then we gaze upon it as if were were then first paying attention.

(*De natura hominis* 7; R.W. Sharples and P.J. van der Eijk, *Nemesius On the Nature of Man*, Liverpool University Press, 2008, 104--105)

Sharples and Eijk are uncertain about the identity of the geometricians. Doma´nski cites Galen *On the Usefulness of Parts* 10 12. Following that suggestion, Sharples and Eijk also cite Galen, *On the Doctrines of Hippocrates and Plato* 7 5 40, and Alexander of Aphrodisias, *On Aristotle on Snese Perception* 28 2.

See notes on Augustine *De Genesi ad litteram libri duodecim* for a comparison.


# Pseudo-Plutarch

## *Placita*

> Hipparchus, that the visual rays extend from both the eyes to the superficies of bodies, and give to the sight the apprehension of those same bodies, after the same manner in which the hand touching the extremity of bodies gives the sense of feeling.

(*Placita* 4 13; Crowell, *The Complete Works of Plutarch*, volume 3, 1909)

# Augustine

## *De Trinitate*

> For the mind does not know other minds and not know itself, as the eye of the body sees other eyes and does not see itself; for we see bodies through the eyes of the body, because, unless we are looking into a mirror, we cannot refract and reflect the rays themselves which shine for through the eyes, and touch whatever we discern---a subject, indeed, which is treated of most subtly and obscurely, until it be clearly demonstrated whether the fact be so, or whether it be not. But whatever is the nature of the power by which we discern through the eyes, certainly, whether it be rays or anything else, we cannot discern with the eyes that power itself; but we inquire into it with the mind, and if possible, understand this with the mind.

(*De Trinitate* 9 3; Rev Arthur West Haddan, B.D., *On the Trinity, Augustine of Hippo*, Fig, 2012, 238)

Notice that Augustine, after having introduced the extramissionist imagery of rays, immediately brackets that commitment, claiming that it is treated subtly and obscurely and claims that the explanation of perceptual discernment by rays has not yet been clearly demonstrated.

## *De Quantitate Animae*

> Sight extends itself outward and through the eyes darts forth far in every possible direction to light up what we see. Hence it happens that it sees rather in the place where the object seen is present, not in the place from which it goes out to see.

(*De quantitate animae* 23 43; Joseph M. Colleran, C.SS.R, Ph.D., *St Augustine, The Greatness of the Soul, The Teacher, New York, NY: The Newman Press, 1950, 66)

Cited by Gerrard O'Daly, *Augustine's Philosophy of Mind, Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1987 82, 83 as an instance of extramission. However, this occurs in a passage where Augustine is arguing that the sense organ can be affected where it is not, but O'Daly uses the need for contact to argue for the attribution of extramission. Second, nothing in the passage requires an extramissionist metaphysics. It might just as well be a fine description of directing visual attention outwards.

## *De Genesi ad litteram libri duodecim*

> The shaft of rays from our eyes, to be sure, is a shaft of light. It can be pulled in when we focus on what is near our eyes and sent forth when we fix on objects at a distance. But when it is pulled in, it does not altogether stop seeing distant objects, although, of course, it sees them more obscurely than when it focuses its gaze upon them. Nevertheless, the light which is in the eye, according to authoritative opinion, is so slight that without the help of light from outside we should be able to see nothing. Since, Moreover, it cannot be distinguished from the outside light, it is difficult as I have said, to find an analogy by which we might demonstrate the diffusion of light to make the day and a contraction to make the night.

(*De Genesi ad litteram libri duodecim* 1 16; John Hammond Taylor, S.J., *St Augustine, The Literal Meaning of Genesis*, New York NY and Mahway NJ: Paulist Press, 1982, 37--38)

The present extramissionist account is derived neither from scripture nor reason, but is accepted as received authoritative opinion. It is potentially revisable in the way that the deliveries of scripture and reason are not. Nevertheless Augustine's acceptance of extramission here, while defeasible, seems genuine.

A tension in the account raises a potential difficulty, however. Extramission theories are motivated by an apparent need to be in contact with distant sense objects if the perceiver is to be aware of them. But Augustine explicitly denies this in this passage "when it is pulled in, it does not altogether stop seeing distant objects, although, of course, it sees them more obscurely than when it focuses its gaze upon them." The visual ray need not be in contact with the distal object in order to perceive it, but it does so less clearly than if it were. The passage provides a phenomenology of focal attention that seems to conflict with the requirement that the perceiver be in contact with the objects of sensory awareness.

Perhaps the present account is usefully compared to the extramissionist dioptrics that Nemesius attributes to the "geometricians" in *De Hominis* 7. We get a similar description of the phenomenology of focal attention, also set within an extramissionist account, but where the dioptric character of vision is made explicit and exploited in an explanation for how we can see many things all at once. For consider a ray sent from a single eye. It would be natural to expect that it sees only that with which it is in contact. But what we see is not restricted in this way. Reflection on binocular vision provides an explanation. The rays from both eyes form a cone. Where the rays intersect is the point of focal attention where things appear exactly in a way that is meant to be consistent with many other things appearing as well if not exactly. Query: Do the many that appear if not exactly confined to the region within the cone? If so, this model does not fit the Augustinian passage where the object seen, if obscurely, is outside of the cone. If the many that appear if not exactly are not confined to the cone, then we so far lack an explanation of how we see the many in terms of the extramissionist dioptrics.

## *Sermon* 277

411 AD On the Birthday of the Martyr Vincent

> In this very body, which we carry around with us, I can find something whose inexpressible swiftness astonishes me; the ray from our eye, with which we touch whatever we behold. What you see, after all, is what you touch with the ray from your eye.

(*Sermon* 277 10; Edmund Hill, O.P., *The Works of Saint Augustine, A Translation for the 21st Century, Part III, Sermons, Volume 8, 273-305A, On the Saints*, Hyde Park, NY: New City Press, 1994, 38)

Augustine is using the familiar tactile metaphor associated with extramission theories. But what is it a metaphor for? Arguably, touch is a metaphor for the presentation in sight of the object of vision. That we touch whatever we behold may be too weak, by itself, to establish that, but it is combined with the claim that what you see is what you touch with the visual ray. On this reading, visual presentation is either reduced to or is at the very least modelled on tactile presentation. If that is right, then Hill is wrong to speculate that "presumably on meeting a visible object <the rays> send back the message to the subject...or perhaps they bounce straight back to the eye like radar" 46 n.17. The rays, as Hill conceives of them, are merely part of the causal medium through which information about the perceived object is conveyed. But if the visual rays touch the objects of perception, then they are perceived where they are, and thus there is no need for a signal to return to the subject.

Augustine explains occlusion as the obstruction of visual rays. This could not be an argument for the extramission theory, as occlusion is equally well explained on the intromissionist hypothesis. Rather, the example of a man obscuring a distant column, is setting up the real topic of *Sermon* 277 10, the "inexpressible swiftness" of the visual rays, which will lead Augustine to an interpretation of Paul's phrase "in the twinkling of an eye" (1 Corinthians 15:52) in *Sermon* 277 11, understood as the speed at which the body will be resurrected.

Augustine speaks of the "inexpressible swiftness" of the visual rays, but, strictly speaking, their action is instantaneous. If two objects, one near---a man---and one far---a column---are visible to the perceiver, in the circumstances of perception (and hence the man no longer occludes the column), then it is not the case that the visual rays reach the near object sooner than the far: 

> You don't get to him sooner and to it later; and here he is, nearby, and it's a long way off. If you wanted to walk, you would get to the man sooner than to the column; because you wanted to see, you have got to the column as soon as the man. 

> And yet, as soon as you open your eyes, lo and behold, you yourself are here, your ray is there. As soo as you wanted to see it, you reached it by seeing it. ... Just opening your eyes constitutes reaching it.

(*Sermon* 277 10; Edmund Hill, O.P., *The Works of Saint Augustine, A Translation for the 21st Century, Part III, Sermons, Volume 8, 273-305A, On the Saints*, Hyde Park, NY: New City Press, 1994, 39)

Notice that the "inexpressible swiftness" of the visual rays is contrasted with the speed of corporeal processes such as walking. Perhaps, like Philoponus, Augustine maintains that instantaneous action at a distance is only possible for incorporeal activity (*In de anima* 325 1-341 9). After all, instantaneous action at a distance would require a body to travel at infinite speed, but bodies, no matter how swift, only travel at finite speeds. 

The contrast that Augustine draws between the speed of the eyelid in opening one's eyes and the speed of the visual rays thereby unleashed is also relevant:

> The twinling of an eye does not consist in closing and opening the eyelids, because this is done more slowly than seeing. You bat an eyelid more slowly than you direct a ray. Your ray gets to the sky more quickly than the batted eyelids reach the eyebrow.

(*Sermon* 277 11; Edmund Hill, O.P., *The Works of Saint Augustine, A Translation for the 21st Century, Part III, Sermons, Volume 8, 273-305A, On the Saints*, Hyde Park, NY: New City Press, 1994, 39)


# Achilles Tatius

## *Clitophon and Leucippe*

> the outward emanation of beauty, which flow through the eyes into the soul, is a kind of copulation between separated bodies, and is not far from physical sex.

Cited in *Plotinus, Myth, Metaphor and Philosophical Practice* by Stephen R. L. Clark Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press, 2016 who cites it from Bartsch.

Not clear that this is an example of extramission. Is the claim that beauty emanates from the eyes ("the look of love")? Or is the claim that emanated beauty is taken in through the eyes?
