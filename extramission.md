# Nemesius Bishop of Emisa

## *De natura hominis*

> Hipparchus says that rays extend from the eyes and with their extremities lay hold on external bodies like the touch of hands, (2) and thus transmit their reception to the sense of sight. 

(*De natura hominis* 7; R.W. Sharples and P.J. van der Eijk, *Nemesius On the Nature of Man*, Liverpool University Press, 2008, 104)

Sharples and Eijk note that Hipparchus of Nicæa was a 2nd-century BCE astronomer and geographer and that the present passage is virtually identical to Aëtius/Pseudo-Plutarch *Placita* (*Tenets*) 4.13

# Pseudo-Plutarch

## *Placita*

> Hipparchus, that the visual rays extend from both the eyes to the superficies of bodies, and give to the sight the apprehension of those same bodies, after the same manner in which the hand touching the extremity of bodies gives the sense of feeling.
